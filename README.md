# HR Data Dashboard

This project demonstrates my skills in data analysis and dashboard creation using Power BI. The dataset consists of raw HR data stored in an Excel file, which I cleaned and processed using Power Query, and then visualized using Power BI.

## Project Overview

In this project, I focused on analyzing key HR metrics such as employee attendance, work from home trends, and sick leave statistics. The final product is a series of interactive dashboards that provide insights into employee behavior and attendance patterns over time.

### Dashboards Created

1. **Employee Information Dashboard**:

   - Provides detailed metrics for each employee, including:
     - Attendance percentage (%)
     - Number of days present at work
     - Sick leave percentage (%)

2. **Attendance Over Time Dashboard**:

   - Visualizes employee attendance trends over a period, allowing the viewer to analyze how attendance has varied for all employees.

3. **Work From Home Over Time Dashboard**:

   - Tracks the number of days employees worked from home over time.

4. **Sick Leave Over Time Dashboard**:
   - Shows sick leave patterns over time for all employees, helping to identify trends or anomalies.

## Technologies Used

- **Excel**: Used to store and structure the raw HR data.
- **Power Query**: Applied to clean, transform, and prepare the data for analysis.
- **Power BI**: Utilized for building the interactive dashboards and visualizing the data insights.

## How to Use

1. **Data File**: The raw HR data is available in the `HR_data.xlsx` file.
2. **Power BI File**: The `.pbix` file contains all the dashboards with data visualizations.

## Insights & Findings

Through the analysis, key HR trends such as attendance rates, remote work trends, and patterns in sick leave were identified, offering a clear overview of employee presence and absence behavior over time.
